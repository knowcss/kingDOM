# kingDOM
KingDOM, The innerHTML Alternative.

```
// kingdom.js will render and re-render innerHTML in any element with diff and ZERO virtual DOM.
// The render is blazing fast and will apply complex changes without slowdown or memory/events leaks.
// That means your html always stays up to date with zero chance of DOM confusion.
<script> $html('#root', '<span>ready</spa>'); </script>
<div id="root"></div>
```
